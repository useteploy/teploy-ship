# Self-hosting Teploy Ship

Issues in, pull requests out, on your own box. One `teploy deploy` from
this repo brings up the dashboard, the worker, and a Nucleus store; the
optional gateway and sandbox daemon complete the production shape.

## What runs where

| Piece | What | How it deploys |
|---|---|---|
| `ship` (web + worker) | dashboard/webhooks + the durable agent executor | `teploy deploy` from this repo (server-side image build) |
| `ship-nucleus` | durable runs, intake, spend, code index | accessory in `teploy.yml` (automatic) |
| `ship-gateway` | BYO-model AI gateway; provider keys never reach ship | `teploy deploy` from `../teploy-gateway` (optional but recommended) |
| `teploy-sandbox` | per-run containers with default-deny egress | systemd service on the host (see below) |

## 1. Bring-up

Prereqs on your machine: the `teploy` CLI pointed at your server
(`servers.yml`), Node 22 + pnpm, and the Neutron checkout as a sibling
(`../../Neutron`) — ship's SDK deps are workspace links.

```sh
# build what the image copies in
pnpm run build && (cd web && pnpm run build)
bash -c 'rm -rf deploy/vendor && mkdir -p deploy/vendor && for p in neutron-ai neutron-workflow neutron-agents neutron neutron-cli; do (cd ../../Neutron/typescript/packages/$p && pnpm pack --pack-destination "$OLDPWD/deploy/vendor" >/dev/null); done'

# secrets (once; injected into web + worker on every deploy)
teploy secret set SHIP_WEB_TOKEN=<dashboard login/bearer>
teploy secret set SHIP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<webhook HMAC>
teploy secret set SHIP_GIT_TOKEN=<forgejo/gitea deploy token>
teploy secret set SHIP_GITHUB_TOKEN=<github token>        # only for github.com repos
teploy secret set AI_GATEWAY_KEY=<key from teploy-gateway>  # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY directly

teploy deploy
```

The dashboard is at `<server>:7460` (`ingress: host` — firewall it to
your VPN/tailnet, e.g. `ufw allow from 100.64.0.0/10 to any port 7460`).
Log in with `SHIP_WEB_TOKEN`.

## 2. Connect a source

Add a webhook on the repo (or org):

- URL: `http://<server>:7460/hooks/forgejo` or `/hooks/github`
- Secret: the `SHIP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` value (Forgejo: HMAC signature;
  GitHub: `X-Hub-Signature-256`)
- Events: issues, issue comments (PR review loop), labels

Then label an issue **`ship`**. Unlabeled events are ignored — the label
is the opt-in. The issue appears in the dashboard inbox as a *proposed*
task; Launch it, or flip the source to **auto** on the Sources page.
Auto is bounded three ways: a daily launch cap, a concurrency ceiling,
and a per-source daily spend budget (`SHIP_DAILY_BUDGET_USD`).

PR review loop: any non-`[teploy-ship]` comment on a `ship`-labeled PR
proposes a follow-up task; the run pushes to the PR branch and replies.

## 3. Sandbox (recommended for anything untrusted)

The worker's default local executor is fine for code-fix tasks; the
sandbox daemon gives every run its own container with **default-deny
egress** — an internal bridge with no route out, plus an allowlist proxy
(package registries + GitHub built in) on the bridge gateway.

```sh
# on the server
install -m 0755 teploy-sandbox /usr/local/bin/
systemctl enable --now teploy-sandbox     # unit: serve --addr 0.0.0.0:7439
ufw allow from 172.18.0.0/16 to any port 7439 proto tcp   # teploy app net → daemon
ufw allow from 172.31.99.0/24 to any port 7443 proto tcp  # sandbox net → egress proxy
```

Extend the egress allowlist per host (your git server!) via the unit env:
`SBX_EGRESS_ALLOW=git.internal:3000,.mycorp.dev` — entries are `host`,
`.suffix`, or `host:port`; portless entries open only 80/443.

Point ship at it (in `teploy.yml` env or secrets):
`SHIP_SANDBOX_URL=http://172.18.0.1:7439`, `SHIP_SANDBOX_TOKEN=<token
from /var/lib/teploy-sandbox/token>`, `SHIP_SANDBOX_IMAGE=golang:1.24`
(pick your stack), `SHIP_SANDBOX_NETWORK=egress`.

## 4. Codebase indexing (optional)

Give the agent semantic code search: any OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/embeddings` endpoint works. The gateway proxies one — its
`teploy.yml` ships an Ollama accessory:

```sh
# once, on the gateway box
docker exec ship-gateway-ollama ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Then set `SHIP_EMBED_MODEL: ollama/nomic-embed-text` in ship's env
(SHIP_EMBED_URL/_KEY default to the gateway settings). Repo runs index
the clone incrementally (file-hash diff) into Nucleus vectors and the
agent gets a ```search action.

## 5. Security model (what protects what)

- **Label gate**: only `ship`-labeled issues/PRs ever become tasks;
  webhooks are HMAC-verified.
- **Approvals**: destructive/network/privilege actions park the run for
  a human decision (dashboard or CLI); plan-preview (`--plan` / the
  "plan first" checkbox) parks before anything runs at all.
- **Injection defense**: external task text is framed as
  data-not-instructions; matched injection patterns surface as an
  `injection-guard` step on the run timeline.
- **Egress**: sandbox runs can only reach allowlisted hosts; everything
  else has no route.
- **Secrets**: agent commands never see operator env secrets (scrubbed
  on local executors, absent in sandboxes); git tokens are used
  harness-side only and are picked per host (Forgejo vs GitHub).
- **Spend**: per-source daily budgets + global concurrency caps.

## Day-2

- `teploy deploy` redeploys; secrets persist. Run state lives in
  Nucleus (accessory volume) — containers are disposable.
- `teploy accessory upgrade nucleus ghcr.io/neutron-build/nucleus:latest`
  picks up engine updates.
- CI runs on Forgejo Actions (`.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml`) with a
  sibling-Neutron checkout — register any docker-labeled runner.
